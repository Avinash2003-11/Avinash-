    <h1>IRULIL URUVAM</h1>
    <p>There are five friends namely Arun , Avinash , Santhosh , Muthu  , Haribalaji. They are friends since chilodhood.</p>
    <p>one day, while they are travelling in the train, Arun says that his uncle owns a bangla(palace) and now the palace is abonded. We ca go inside that and stays for one night.</p>
    <p>but muthu and Haribalaji rejected this idea because they both fear of night but arun , Santhosh and Avinash complelled them and made them accept the deal</p>
    <p>they reached the palace the next day amd went inside. When the night falls, they decided to play truth or dare. during the play, muthu got the dare and told by friends to go to the bedroom and come alone.</p>
    <p>when muthu reached the door of the bedroom, he hears a voice snoring inside. he could not able to open the door. exhausted, he decided to move down and tell lie to the friends. when he turned the door opened. muthu heared the noise and turned back and peeped inside the room</p>
    <p>he saw a shadow entering in to the restroom. he went to the restroom and checked out. once he stepped inside the restrom the door locked automatically. he starts screaming but the voice was not heared outside.</p>
    <p>inside the restroom, the shadow appeared infront of him and started to struggle his neck. after a long time of struggle finally the shadow dissappears leaving a message in the wall in bllod like "get out"</p>
    <p>he went down back and said all the happenings to other members but no one believed. that night, Avinash was thirsty and came down to drink water. when we came to the kitchen, he feels like someone is following him. when he suddenly turned back, he saw a number of cementries around him and all the dead bodies inside the cementry came up alive and running towards him. he screams in fear suddenly all came back to normal</p>
    <p>other friends came down runningand asked what happened. he narrated what he sae but they thought that he pranked them so no one believes. These things started repeating for days but no one bothers except avinash and he decided to investigate with arun.</p>
    <p>first arun rejects but Avinash promises that all the things what he and muthu saw is true so arun reluctantly agrees and they both stepped in to the investigation.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>First they went inside the restroom where the message written and watched it.Then they both went to his uncle and said about the strange happenings. he was shocked and asked wheather they took the book and read. </p>
    <p>confused, they asked about the book. he answers that there is a book in the basement called "IRULIL URUVAM" they answered no but uncle said that " no someone took the book but they didnt read that because if they read already, the happenings will be more haunted.</p>
    <p>also he said that it is book which belongs to a demon names "REXO" and the demon will release if anyone reads the 6 wordings in the book.</p>
    <p>they both rushed to the palace and asked the three others about the book. after asking them rudeky, santhosh agreed that he only took the boom from the basement but didn't read</p>
    <p>Haribalaji shocked and grabbed the book from santhosh hand. arun and avinash tried to grab the book from his hands but he satrted to read the all wordings. the main rule is if we started to read the boom once we can't stop until the wordings complete</p>
    <p>The six wordings are:</p>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>kannadiyum maranamagalam</li>
            <li>irunda idamellam marmam</li>
            <li>thirumbinal aabathu</li>
            <li>alikum oli</li>
            <li>thaneerum rathamagalam</li>
            <li>IRULIL URUVAM</li>
        </ol>
        
    </div>
    <p>After reading, haribalaji flewed in the air and the demon smashes his head, killing him. horrified by seeing this all of them ran away and hid in seperte places.</p>
